# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Overview of the Project
My website is about Nike shop mainly selling nike shoes. I made it simple for users to use, and so it is not confusing. First page will be the Women and Men pages on top right side and inside are basically just are shoes for sale. 
Second page is Basketball shoes for women and it has all shoes for basketball with prices. 
Third page will be Football and inside are shoes and prices. Fourth page is Running shoes with prices. 
At the bottom I have four pages which are the Collections, Contact, About Us and Shop. I have added the nike with my name on the side.

## Languages
My website is created using Javascript, HTML and css.
I found the Javascript the hardest to do.

## Purpose of the repo
To create a functional website using sveltekit to a profesional standards. 
I made this repo to inspired others and to know improve more of my designing skills for making a website. 

## Technnology I used
API, I had to fetch some data from an API. 

## Known bugs
All of my pages are not totally done, they do not have any photos of any shoes. I only have details for each of the pages.

## Future Roadmap
Finish all the pages for my websites and make it better.
Add some more details and designs.
